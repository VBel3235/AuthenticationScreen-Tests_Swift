# AuthenticationScreen-Tests_Swift
This simple project showcase authorization screen, with local checking of email and password, check email requirements, such as register, usage of numerals etc. Also, I used Unit tests to check whether the interface works correctly

All elements in interface are done programatically, every object is a reusable object
